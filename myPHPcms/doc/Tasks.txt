Author: Phil Lee

This document is just a container for ideas related to the task that 
need to be completed for myPHPcms.  It shows the major tasks (in 
capitals) and the sub-tasks that belong to these (in lower case).  
Eventually these will be defined within the BerliOS task manager 
module.

The work items are ordered so that the base functionality which would
be sufficient to run a basic website will be completed if the tasks
were stepped through sequentially.
