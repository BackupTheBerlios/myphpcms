EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document describes typical usage patterns that will need to be
handled by the various modules of myPHPcms.  This document has been
put together in order to develop the capabilities and interactions
between the various modules.

1.0	Master administrator activities

1.1	Installation and creation of master administrator

This scenario walks through the set up of the site from the initial
unpacking of the script archive to setting up the master site 
administrator as a user.  It assumes a totally clean installation.  In
other words there is no pre-existing installation of myPHPcms on the
server.

  1	Download latest version of script archive.
  2	Extract files in archive into root directory of web server
  3	Edit the config.php file to enter the location of the site
	root, database username, password and host and text phrase
	for generating security hashes.  The site domain name is
	also required.
  4	In web browser click on http://localhost/admin/master/setup.php
  5	This attempts to connect to database specified
  6	User completes form indicating their email address, real name
	and choice of password (twice)
  7	The password is checked for consistency and is then encrypted
	using an md5() hash of the password and the secret phrase
  8	This information (email address, real name, password and 
  	security hash) is then entered into the database.  The user is
  	marked as inactive.
  9	An email containing an activation URL pointing to 
	http://www.domain-name.com/admin/master_confirm.php is then 
	sent to the user.
 10	Once clicked in the users email client this passes the
	activation hash to the confirmation script.
 11	This script checks for entries matching the hash and if found
	sets the user with that hash to be active.
 12	The script then invites the user to go to the main 
 	administration page by displaying the URL 
 	http://localhost/admin/login.php

1.1	Master administrator log on

1.2	Master administrator creating channel

1.3	Master administrator creating sub-master administrator

2.0	Channel administrator

3.0	Non-logged in visitor

4.0	Logged in visitor

5.0	Channel editor

6.0	Channel moderator

7.0	Channel contributor
