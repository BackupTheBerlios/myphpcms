myPHPcms Detailed Design document - Access Logging module
=========================================================

Version 0.1
-----------

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document describes in detail the Access Logging Module.  It
provides information on the design of the module, the database design,
the individual scripts, any dependencies that these scripts may have 
and provides detailed references for each function in each file or 
library.

1.0	SCOPE

This document describes the design and operation of the Access Logging
module that allows page accesses to the website or channels to logged 
to a database.  This database can be interogated at any time by the 
site or channel administrators to determine the numbers and frequncies
of users, the most popular pages and the most frequently sought web
pages.

The system is applicable to both PHP scripts and static HTML pages 
allowing this system to be used to track both dynamic and static web
sites together with those that mix the two together through the use
of a static cache of dynamically generated web pages.

3.0	OVERVIEW

Why use a database backed logging solution instead of log files ?
Basically because of information availability and speed.  Data is 
gathered on each hit that occurs on the site.  Analysis of this data
can be carried out at anytime and does not require the processing of 
long log files - instead this task can be carried out by a graphcal 
front-end which queries the logging database.  This means that any 
query run will be run on the most up to date data available.

The logging system can be applied to either PHP pages or HTML pages.  
Any requests made to the webserver will result in the following 
information being stored:

     * name of page requested
     * date and time of request
     * session id (if applicable)
     * site id (allows multiple sites to be logged)
     * browser type, version and platform
     * name of script calling logging system
     * ip of requesting host
     * name of requesting server (if resolvable)
     * referring web page or host
     * name of page that user is going to (click-thru tracking)

All of this information is stored in a single database table called
logging_log.  It is defined in logging.sql.

Any request made to the webserver can be made to generate an SQL query
to log details of the request in the database.  If the file being 
requested is a PHP script then this can be achieved by including the 
following line somewhere in the script:

     include("$site_root/libs/inc_logger.php");
     
If, however, the page requested is purely an HTML page or it resides on
a server that does not allow the use of PHP then the following 'GIF' 
can be displayed on the page:

   <img src="gif11.php?site_id=0&page=index.html" width='1' height='1'>

Note that there are additinal parameters that need to be specified for 
the 'GIF' solution.  These are specified in the Reference section at 
the end of this document.

The GIF solution is quite ingenious - instead of displaying a GIF it 
calls a PHP file located on a server that can run PHP which parse the
request, inserts the relevant data into the database and then passes 
through a transparent 1x1 GIF image ('clear.gif').

When the user leaves the site it can be desireable to know where they 
are going.  This can be useful in the context of tracking whether users
click on a banner or a link to another website.  To allow this is to be
monitored the following script can be used:

  <a href="logging/redir.php?e=http://www.phpbuilder.com">Link name</a>

This inserts the URL of the link that the user has clicked on together 
with other data that can be gleaned from the execution of the script.  
The target URL is then opened in the same window as the request was 
made.

All of these techniques rely upon the insertion of data into the SQL 
database.  On a heavily used site this may result in some deterioration
of performance so, in order to minimise this, the SQL INSERTS are 
delayed until the table is free.

Once the data is contained within the database it can be queried to 
generate the following information:

     * hourly requests
     * browser types
     * most requested pages
     * least requested pages
     * total page views since logging began
     * top referrers
     * top hosts requesting pages
     * top search strings
     * browser operating systems
     * top site entry pages
     * top site exit pages

It is suggested that this script be placed in a location that is only 
available to the site administrator such as $site_root/admin.

All of these functions support the specification of the site_id to be
investigated and (optionally) a maximum number of results that should 
be returned.  All results (with the exception of total page views since
logging began) can have the timescale over which the statistics should 
be reported defined by setting the $timescale to one of the following:
'today', 'yesterday', 'thisweek', 'thismonth', 'thisquarter', 
'thisyear'.

Host name and IP address data is stored in the following format in 
MySQL in table logging_cache:

	FIELD       DEFAULT      TYPICALLY
	ip_address  none         192.168.7.24

table logging_unknown

	FIELD       DEFAULT      TYPICALLY
	user_agent  None         Mozilla/4.0b2 (Win95; I)*


5.0	SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

The access logging system consists of the following files:

5.1	$SITE_ROOT/admin/adm_statistics.php

	This script allows the processing of the data gathered by the
	logging system.  It is intended to be executed by the site or
	channel administrators only.

5.2	$SITE_ROOT/logging/inc_logger.php

	This is the code snippet that is required to log access to PHP
	scripts.  It must be included into the script whose activity is
	to be logged.
	
5.3	$SITE_ROOT/logging/gif11.php

	This is a fake GIF file that static HTML pages can use to allow
	their pages to be logged by the logging system.  It provides
	exactly the same information as that provided by the PHP code
	snippet described above.

5.4 	$SITE_ROOT/logging/clear.gif

	This is a 1 pixel by 1 pixel transparent GIF file that is 
	echoed back to the users browser by the giff1.php script after 
	the logging information has been gathered.

5.5	$SITE_ROOT/logging/redir.php

	This script is used to wrap up destination URL's in order that
	user clicks onto hyperlinks can be tracked.  This script can
	also be used to track banner advert clicks (if required).

5.6	$SITE_ROOT/sql/logging.sql

	This is the SQL that creates the tables necessary for the 
	correct operation of the logging system.
	
5.7	$SITE_ROOT/lib_browser.php

	This is the library that identifies the browser type and 
	version, the operating system and the hardware platform from
	the User Agent string reported by the browser.


6.0	DEPENDENCIES

This module requires access to the database in order to store the data
that it collects about the users browser.  In order to identify the 
users browser this module requires the browser identification library
lib_browser.php.


7.0	REFERENCE

This section describes in detail the internal and external functions
that are available in each of the scripts that make up the Access 
Logging module.  The functions are grouped together by script name.

7.1	adm_statistics.php

7.1.1	function hourly_requests($link_id, $site_id, $timescale)

	Lists the number of hits per hour for the given $site_id and 
	$timescale.

7.1.2	function browser_types($link_id, $site_id, $timescale)

	Lists the browser name, vesion, platform and percentage share 
	of all requests for the specfied $site_id over the specified 
	$timescale in descending order of popularity.

7.1.3	function top_pages($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the most frequently requested pages for the site with the 
	matching $site_id over the time period $timescale in descending
	order.  Results are limited to $max_num rows of data.

7.1.4	function bottom_pages($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the least popular pages for the site matching $site_id 
	over the time period $timescale.  Results are limited to the 
	$max_num rows.

7.1.5	function total_page_views($link_id, $site_id)

	Determines the total number of page requests since the site 
	began logging.

7.1.6	function top_referrers($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the most common referers for site $site_id over the time 
	period $timescale.  Results are limited to $max_num rows.  The 
	returned values are presented as hyperlinks so that they may be 
	clicked.

7.1.7	function top_hosts($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the most common hosts that request pages for site 
	$site_id over the time period $timescale.  Results are 
	limited to $max_num rows.  Where possible the host IP 
	addresses are resolved via a reverse DNS lookup.  To speed 
	subsequent runs of this query the host IP addresses and names 
	are cached in the database table logging_cache.  The returned
	values are presented as hyperlinks so that they may be clicked
	for investigation.

7.1.8	function searches($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the most common queries that have been executed to find 
	the site.  This information is obtained by searching all 
	referring URLs for the words 'search' and 'query'.  Results are
	limited to $max_num rows.
     
7.1.8	function operating_sys($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the most common operating systems used to access the site
	$site_id over the specified time scale $timeperiod.  The number
	of rows returned is limited to $max_num.

7.1.9	function top_entry($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the most commonly seen page by visitors when they enter 
	the site $site_id.  In theory this will be the home page but if
	enough traffic comes in from a link then it may be the page 
	that has been linked to.  The time period over which the query 
	runs can be set from the $timescale variable.  The number of 
	rows returned is defined by the value of the $max_num variable.

7.1.10	function top_exit($link_id, $site_id, $timescale, $max_num)

	Lists the most commonly departed pages from site $site_id to 
	allow the estimation of traffic flows to another site or 
	perhaps an advert.  The number of rows returned is set by 
	$max_num.

7.2	inc_logger.php

	
	
7.3	gif11.php
