OUTLINE STRUCTURE OF MTB-Wales.com
==================================

MTB-Wales.com will consist of a series of directories containing the
libraries that give the site it's functionality.  All HTML code will
be separate from the PHP code that runs the site.  This, in conjunction
with the templating system, will make the site totally generic and easy
to customise with relatively little effort.

The directory structure is as follows:

$site_root
    |
    +-admin      contains configuration & administrator scripts
    +-doc        contains library design documents (incl this one)
    +-libs       contains the actual script libraries
    +-sql        contains the fragments of SQL necessary to build the 
                 tables for the various sub-components
    +-tools      contains tools to test scripts
    
Note that the site root directory holds the bulk of the scripts that
call the libraries.  Only the scripts that allow the administration#
of the site are located outside of this directory.
