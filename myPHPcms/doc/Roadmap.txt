EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document describes the proposed release schedule for myPHPcms 
which is a MySQL/PHP based Content Management System.  It details
the functionality that can be found in each release.  The overall
functionality of the package is outlined in the myPHPcms Functional
Specification document.

This schedule is subject to change, particularly in the case of the 
later releases.


1.0	SCOPE

This document describes the release schedule for myPHPcms which is 
a MySQL/PHP based Content Management System.  It details the 
functionality that can be found in each release.  The overall
functionality of the package is outlined in the myPHPcms Functional
Specification document.

It is anticipated that the initial release of the software will have
minimal functionality, much less than the 'core' functionality defined
in the Functional Specification document.  This will be a demonstrator 
to show that the basic modules will integrate together.

The release schedule will involve the development of 'Alpha' releases
which contain progressively more functionality and bug fixes for the
major bugs.  Once all of the functionaility has been incorporated the
releases will be considered to have moved to 'Beta' status.  This
phase will be solely concerned with bug fixing.

The 'Beta' release should be stable enough for production use but in
practice the later Alpha releases could also be used.  Their use in a
production environment will allow bugs to be identified that have not
been identified as a result of testing.

It is anticapated that 3 Alpha releases and 3 Beta releases will be
produced.
