3.0	OVERVIEW

The steps that the installation script carries out are:

1.  Check for presence of a flag indicating that myPHPcms has already
    been installed.  If found call the upgrade script otherwise call
    the setup.php.
    
2.  Setup.php will display a form to allow gather the database host 
    name and the database username and password.  The password will
    be requested twice for verification.  Once submitted these values
    will be written to a text file called db.cfg
    
3.  The page will then reload and will attempt to connect to the
    database server.  If no connection can be established the form
    to gather the database username, hostname and address will be
    redisplayed so that the user can correct them.
    
4.  If the connection can be established then the administrator
    sign-up and login screen should be displayed so that the overall
    site administrator can enter their username and password and have
    their account activiated via email.
    
5.  Once the user is signed in the administration directory is 
    protected via Apache's .htaccess and .htpasswd files.
