INSTALL

This document will detail the steps necessary to install myPHPcms on a
server running PHP, MySQL and Apache.

The process will go something like this.

1.  Unpack the tarball in the root directory of your webserver

2.  From a web browser go to http://your.servername.com/admin/setup.php

3.  Enter the MySQL database host name, the databa se username and 
    password into the form fields.  When asked check that these are
    correct.  These values will now be written to a configuration file.
    
4.  The connection to the database will be tested.  If it fails you will
    will get the oppotunity to correct the values entered in step 3.  If
    successful the database tables will be created.
    
5.  The administration directory will then be password protected using
    Apaches .htaccess and .htpasswd files.  You will then be taken to
    the main myPHPcms page where you can log in and set up your default
    channel.
