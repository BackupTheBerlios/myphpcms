Version 0.7 23 October 2001 - Philip Lee

CHANGELOG
---------
0.7   23/10/01   Added table logging_cache to store host names
                 and IP addresses in order to reduce number of
                 reverse DNS lookups that are required when using
                 the access statistics.
0.6   22/10/01   Added redir.php script which takes the URL that
                 the user clicks on and stores it in the database
                 to allow us to see where the users are going when
                 they leave the site.  Completed browser_types(),
                 hourly_requests(), top_pages(), bottom_pages(),
                 top_referrers(), top_hosts(), searches(),
                 operating_sys(), top_entry() and top_exit() in
                 lib_statistics.php.  Also added error handler to
                 allow for when a SQL query returns no data.
0.5   19/10/01   Created SQL sub-queries to allow the limitation
                 of the scope of results returned to (1) today,
                 (2) this week, (3) this month, (4) this quarter,
                 (5) this year.  Added quite a few additional
                 functions to allow the reporting of data logged.
0.4   17/10/01   Brought database dump format in line with that
                 on live system on apok.dreamhost.com in order
                 to provide real data to develop lib_statistics.php
                 against.  Created lib_statistics.php in admin/libs
                 directory and added total_page_views() and
                 browser_types() functions.  Also created 
                 adm_statistics.php to get visitor information.
0.3   16/10/01   Added correct header to inc_logging.php.  Added
                 exit.php to record exit pages (not finished).
0.2   27/09/01   Added extra fields to database scheme to store
                 integer user ID (user_id) and also exit page string
                 (exit_page).  Also added gif11.php and clear.php to
                 allow logging of static HTML pages into loggign system.
0.1   24/09/01   Inital version of inc_logging.php created
