0.2   05/11/01   Completely rewrote browser_get_agent to detect all
                 known browsers using defintions from BrowserHawk
                 and latest version of browscap.ini together with the
                 results of logging $HTTP_USER_AGENT for the 
                 Singletrack Mind Website.
0.1   23/10/01   Initial version created.  Very simply detection
                 of common browsers (IE, Netscape, Opera and Konqueror).
