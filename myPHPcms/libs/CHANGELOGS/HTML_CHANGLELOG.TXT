Version 0.7 28 September 2001 - Philip Lee

CHANGELOG
---------

0.7   28/09/01   Removed high level open_table as not required if conv_html
                 is to be used to generate lib_html output from raw HTML
                 input.  Added classes to open/close <HEAD> tag, write out
                 <META> tag, <TITLE></TITLE> and to write <SCRIPT> tag out.
                 Also added <link> tag for style sheets.  Updated README
                 file to reflect addition of new tags and corrected some
                 errors.
0.6   27/09/01   Added classes to open and close HTML tags, to write out
                 HTML comment <!-- blah blah --> to document and to open
                 and close <BODY> tag
0.5   26/09/01   Deleted class href_close and replaced href_open with new
                 class href which opens the href tag, inserts the link,
                 adds the text and then closes the tag.  Also replaced
                 \r\n at line ends with <eol> which is then replaced in
                 the newly added pretty_html function.
0.4   18/09/01   Deleted comment demarking private functions.  Added comment
                 to identify the location of the high level table writing
                 routines - open_table, write_row, close_table.
0.3   14/09/01   Added support for the <th></th> table tags, <font></font>
                 tags, <a href=></a> tags,<img> tag.  Also added <hr>,
                 <form></form>, <select></select>, <option></option> tags.
                 Also added <textarea></textarea> tags.  Finally, the
                 following tags have been introduced: <p></p>, <br>,
                 <blockquote></blockquote>, <ol></ol>, <ul></ul> and <div>
0.2   13/09/01   Added support for text tags <h1-6></h1-6>, <pre></pre>,
                 <b></b>,<i></i>, <tt></tt>, <cite></cite>, <em></em>,
                 and <strong></strong>.  Tags can be entered singularly
                 eg <b> or in groups <b><i>.  All tags will be converted
                 to uppercase and closing tags will be reversed so that
                 <b><i> becomes </i></b>.                 
0.1   12/09/01   Initial version of lib_html with basic support for
                 tables only <table></table>,<td></td>,<tr></tr>
