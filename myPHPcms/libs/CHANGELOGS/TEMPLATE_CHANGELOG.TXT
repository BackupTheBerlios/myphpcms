PHP-Templating system for use in dynamic websites
+-----------------------------------------------+

CHANGELOG
---------

0.7   30/09/01   Added additional table to template SQL schema
                 to store site_id (key) and site name, URL,
                 contact email address etc.  In addition the
                 template table were renamed to tpl_ in order
                 to allow them to by identified from other tables
                 in a site where lots of tables are being used.
0.6   12/09/01   Worked around the bug that prevented the use of
                 double quotes (") in local templates by using
                 single quotes (').  Also removed code that was
                 needed to fix problem with single quote (') in
                 text eg this doesn't work.
0.5   10/09/01   Fixed bug where template system would crash if no
                 templates are found in the database and/or the
                 session file is too old.  Modified default template
                 site_id to be 1.  Site_id of 0 is that of base system
                 and should not be deleted.
0.4   07/09/01   Earlier versions of the templating system accessed
                 the database in order to get the template names and
                 to count the number of templates even though the
                 actual values of templates were pulled from the
                 database.  This has now been rectified by storing
                 the global variable string in the session file.
                 This means that the templates load 50% faster.
                 In addition modifications have also been made to 
                 the parse_template function to reduce the number 
                 of database accesses that it required from 3 to 
                 none.
0.3   05/09/01   Modified database schema and lib_templates.php to
                 allow the templating system to store multiple 
                 templates for multiple sites.  This would allow
                 the development of a new site-wide design whilst
                 still allowing users to use the old site design or
                 it would allow the virtual hosting of several sites
                 on the same database.
0.2   04/09/01   Added create_local_template, refresh_local_template,
                 delete_local_template functions to manage local
                 template variables
0.1   01/098/01  Initial release.  Basic functionality includes the
                 creation and editing static templates and the ability
                 to store these in local session files in order to
                 prevent excessive database requests
